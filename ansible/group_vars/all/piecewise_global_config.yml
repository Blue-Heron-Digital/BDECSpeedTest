# 1. PIECEWISE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION #
#####################################
#
# In this section you will update variables that configure the Piecewise application
# for the remote VM or server.
#
# Required fields are indicated with the text "# !REQUIRED!" just below the variable name.
# If a field is marked Required, you must enter a value or change the default value.

env: production
# !REQUIRED!
#
# env   Instructs Ansible whether this is a server/VM in development or in production.
#
#       Supported values: production, development
#
#       Use development if you only have an IP address for your server/VM.
#       Use production if you have configured DNS to provide a domain name for your server/VM.

project_name: piecewise
# #DEFAULT#
#
# project_name
#       The name of your forked repository. This is likely 'piecewise', unless you have renamed
#       the repository after forking it from https://github.com/opentechinsstute.org/piecewise
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.
#

remote: https://github.com/schelcj
# !REQUIRED!
#
# remote
#       The URL where your repository is available. You can use any valid git remote.
#       For example: https://github.com/opentechinstitute
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

piecewise_commit: mi_moonshot
# !REQUIRED!
#
# piecewise_commit
#       Specify any ref (eg. branch, tag, SHA) to be deployed. This ref must be
#       pushed to the remote git_repo before it can be deployed.
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

git_repo: "{{ remote }}/{{ project_name }}.git"
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

bigquery_project_num: measurement-lab
# !REQUIRED!
#
# bigquery_project_num
#       The BigQuery Project Number or Project Name from your project details in the
#       Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com
#       This can be the numeric project number or the project name text.

database_name: piecewise
database_user: postgres
database_user_group: postgres
# #DEFAULT#
#
#       These variables define the Postgres database name, user and system group for
#       the database user. These can be safely left as the default, unless you desire to
#       change them.

site_fqdn: mi.broadbandtest.us
# !REQUIRED!
#
# site_fqdn
#       FQDN stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name.
#       This value should contain either:
#       - the domain name of your production server, ie: www.mywebsite.com
#       - the IP address of your development or production server, ie: 111.222.333.444
#
#       Use an IP address for development, either on a server/VM on our LAN or a
#       development server/VM on a cloud service like Linode, GCE, Amazon, etc.
#
#       Once you have the server's domain name in DNS working, you can use it instead of the IP address.

#-------------------------------------------->>

########################
# 1.1 SSL CERTIFICATES #
########################
# The variables in this section will be used to generate SSL certificates. When
# deploying to development hosts, the country, state and city are used by openssl to
# generate a self-signed certificate. This is useful when you don't have an DNS name
# set up yet and want to deploy using the host's IP address, or to a server not
# accessible to the Internet.
#

site_contact: mimoonshotprojectteam@merit.edu
site_country: US
site_state: Michigan
site_city: Ann Arbor
site_ou: Merit Network, inc.
# !REQUIRED!
#
# site_contact    These variables are provided to enable automatic generation of
#     _country    SSL certificates, either self-signed for development hosts or
#     ...         valid certificates through the Let's Encrypt CA for production hosts.

self_signed_ssl_cert_path: /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.{{ site_fqdn }}.cert
self_signed_ssl_key_path: /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.{{ site_fqdn }}.key
# #DEFAULT#
#
# When env = 'development', these variables set the directory on the
# server/VM where self-signed SSL certificates will be saved.
# In most cases you will not need to change these values from the default.

letsencrypt_ssl_cert_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ site_fqdn }}/fullchain.pem
letsencrypt_ssl_key_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ site_fqdn }}/privkey.pem
# #DEFAULT#
#
# When env = 'production', these variables set the directory on the
# server/VM where Let's Encrypt SSL certificates will be saved.
# In most cases you will not need to change these values from the default.

#################################
# 1.2 DEPLOYMENT FILE LOCATIONS #
#################################
# The variables in this section determine where specific components will be deployed on
# the remote sytem. These can be largely unchanged, unless your system requires
# different paths.

# #DEFAULT#
#
# Where the base files from your repo will be copied on the remote server.

temp_path: "{{ base_path }}/tmp"
# #DEFAULT#
#
# Temporary location on the remote server where files may be extracted temporarily.
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

########################################
# 2.1 Geodata and Database Information #
########################################
# The section below defines variables used to import your geodata into the database.
#
# The values you set here assume you have located shapefiles for your region.
# You will need the filenames and knowledge of the field names and datatypes in the
# shapefiles for these variables.
#
# Save the geofiles you intend to use for your Piecewise aggregations of
# M-Lab data in the folder: /local_customizations/geofiles/

shape_file: cb_2017_26_bg_500k.shp

# !REQUIRED!

# dbKey             The field name of the unique key in your shape file.
# dbKeyDataType     The data type of dbKey.
# shape_projection  The SRS reprojection/transform to use for this shapefile.

##############################################
# 2.2 Geographic Coordinates and Date Ranges #
##############################################
# Variables in this section define the geographic area and date range you would
# like to use in this Piecewise server.
map_coordinate_southwest:
  lat: 41.61
  lon: -90.47

map_coordinate_northeast:
  lat: 47.59
  lon: -82.34

# The coordinates above define the latitude and longitude for the southwest and
# northeast corners of a bounding box, defining the region from which you are
# interested in pulling M-Lab NDT data.
#
# These four variables are used to format the variable map_bounding_box below.
map_bounding_box: "{{ map_coordinate_southwest.lon }},{{ map_coordinate_southwest.lat }},{{ map_coordinate_northeast.lon }},{{ map_coordinate_northeast.lat }}"
# You do not need to edit the value for map_bounding_box.

map_data_start_date: "Jan 1 2018 00:00:00"
map_data_end_date: "Dec 31 2055 00:00:00"
# !REQUIRED!
#
# map_data_start_date   The range of dates for your server to get M-Lab NDT test data.
# map_data_end_date
#
# During development, we usually set a smaller date range to enable faster ingesting
# of M-Lab data to test the application.
#
# For a production server, it is advisable to set 'map_data_data_end_date'
# to a date well in the future, for example: "Dec 31 2050 00:00:00".

intro_text: >
  More than 380,000 homes in rural Michigan do not have access to broadband. Accurate connectivity data is the first step in assessing community needs and building support for funding sources. Current FCC data aggregation processes may misrepresent broadband availability. These can be overcome by collecting consumer-sourced data through surveys such as this one.

  The Measurement Lab (M-Lab) platform is run by the scientific community.
  We make all test results publicly available via the MeasurementLab.net website
  to help promote Internet research. M-Lab's Network Diagnostic Tool collects a number
  of measures of different facets of your Internet connection. The information published
  includes each device’s IP address, but does not include personal identifying information
  about you as an Internet user.
